## Revolution Idle Guide

Revolution Idle is an incremental game that combines simple mechanics with deep strategic gameplay. This guide covers essential aspects of the game, including progression strategies, challenges, and automation tips.

- *** Game Mechanics Overview
- **Incremental Gameplay**: Players progress by earning resources over time, which can be spent on upgrades to enhance efficiency and unlock new features.
- **Prestige Systems**: The game features multiple layers of prestige, including **Infinity**, **Eternity**, and **Dilation**, each providing unique upgrades and mechanics.
- **Automation**: Players can set up automated systems to optimize resource generation and management, allowing for more efficient gameplay.
- *** Getting Started
1. **Initial Progression**:
    - Focus on unlocking basic upgrades to increase your resource generation.
    - Understand the importance of balancing your resources between immediate upgrades and long-term investments.
2. **Infinity Layer**:
    - Infinity becomes available upon reaching a Revolution Score of $$1.79 \times 10^{308}$$.
    - Completing challenges at this stage rewards Infinity Points (IP), which are crucial for further progression.
3. **Challenges**:
    - Challenges unlock at Infinity Upgrade 7;1 and provide specific handicaps but yield significant rewards upon completion.
    - Completing all 9 challenges allows players to break Infinity, enabling them to exceed the typical score cap and gain more IP.
- *** Strategies for Progression
- **Infinity Upgrades**:
    - Invest in the skill tree as soon as possible. Early upgrades may seem weak but become significantly more powerful as you progress.
    - Prioritize automation upgrades that enhance quality of life during gameplay.
- **Challenge Completion**:
    - Each challenge has specific requirements; plan your upgrades accordingly.
    - Challenges can take varying amounts of time to complete, with some requiring longer runs (e.g., several hours) while others can be done quickly.
- **Automation Setup**:
    - Use automation settings effectively to maximize IP generation.
    - Recommended settings include enabling auto ascensions and setting auto buyables to a high percentage.
- *** Advanced Techniques
- **Long Runs vs. Short Runs**:
    - Long runs (over 5 minutes) tend to yield better results due to cumulative upgrades and improved generator performance.
    - Short runs should be used strategically when trying to complete specific challenges quickly.
- **Eternity Phase**:
    - After achieving sufficient IP through Infinity breaks, players can enter the Eternity phase, which introduces new mechanics and further enhances progression capabilities.
- **Dilation Mechanics**:
    - Dilation introduces another layer of complexity, allowing for even greater resource management strategies. Players should familiarize themselves with its unique features as they progress.

By following these guidelines and strategies, players can effectively navigate the complexities of Revolution Idle, optimizing their gameplay experience while achieving significant progress in the game.
